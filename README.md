Gregtania 6
-----------

Super simple addon for Botania and Gregtech 6. Adds in a few more tiers of orechids to support Gregtech ores.

**New in Gregtania 6:**

- Sand and Gravel can be turned to ores by overworld Orechids
- Gravel can be turned to ores by Orechids Ignem.
- Ore weights are no longer hardcoded, but instead computed from the GregTech world gen parameters. Additional ores may still be added via the JSON weights config.
- Botania pebbles are now replaced by GregTech pebbles, which can be used to craft stone tools
