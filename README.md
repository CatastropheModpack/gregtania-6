Gregtania 6
-----------

Super simple addon for Botania and Gregtech 6. Adds in a few more tiers of orechids to support Gregtech ores.

**New in Gregtania 6:**

- Sand and Gravel can be turned to ores by overworld Orechids
- Gravel can be turned to ores by Orechids Ignem.
- Ore weights are no longer hardcoded, but instead computed from the GregTech world gen parameters. Additional ores may still be added via the JSON weights config.
- Botania pebbles are now replaced by GregTech pebbles, which can be used to craft stone tools
- Clayconia Alluvia added to get early clay from gravel
- Added 1:1 Bonemeal recipe using Botania mortar
- Added 1:4 Blaze Lamp recipe (since Greg replaces the 1:9 with his own Blaze Powder block, and iron is a bit more scarce)
- Manasteel may be made from Wrought Iron or Steel, with a Mana discount for Steel
